# PrimeFactors

This one is simple, or at least the requirements are.
* Create a function which takes an integer argument and returns a list of prime factors in numerical, ascending order.
* Use test driven development
* Think carefully about your test cases. Testing an infinite range is impossible so what do you have to cover to be confident that your code works?
